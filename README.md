A very small minecraft starter mod

## About
This mod adds 1 item (a ruby) to the game.

### Technologies
+ Minecraft Forge, a free, open-source modding API and loader
+ Java
+ JSON

Forge does most of the hard work for you and makes creating the mod almost as easy as coding anything else. Based on my undrstanding it has a decomplied version of minecraft and many ways to interact and modify it.

## Set-up
I'm still in the process of figuting out how to properly export this into a loadable mod, but atm you can test it out by opening it in eclipse and hitting run client.

Pull requests are welcome! for big changes post an issue so we can discuss it
